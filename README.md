### Base Image Choice: Debian

This project uses Debian (penultimate stable version) as the base image for all services.

Debian was chosen for its stability, extensive package ecosystem, and widespread use in production environments. 
It provides predictable behavior, well-documented configuration paths, and compatibility with most tutorials and tools.

For a learning-focused infrastructure project, Debian reduces unnecessary complexity while ensuring reliability and ease of debugging.
